# HardCode Image-Converter

Graphing is a way to counter the problem effectively. However, mismatched or unclear graphs
fail to help us understand the data adequately. We intend to create a software solution that enables
the standardization of graphs to solve this problem.
The tool that we will build will convert the image of a graph into a standardized graph. By doing
so, we will be able to easily interpret the data. It will also extract the function of the graph and
display it to the user. The tool will support multiple graphing functions and graph representations.
