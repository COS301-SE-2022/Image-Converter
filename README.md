# HardCode Image-Converter

## Description
With our current climate of easy access to information, we are faced with the problem of information overload. Therefore it is important that we are able to view data in a concise format. This will allow us to understand the data in a comprehensive manner without getting distracted by unnecessary information. Graphing is a way to counter the problem effectively. However, mismatched or unclear graphs fail to help us understand the data adequately. 
The Image converter is a tool created for a Content Management System (CMS). It hosts a variety of functions of image manipulation, such as image cleaning, classification and filtering. The tool also manages uploaded images in a concise and efficient way.  The tool will be used solely by administrators of the CMS

I pride myself with being an all-rounder, who’s a very fast learner. I am well-organized and dedicated and I am willing to learn whatever language or framework needed to meet any project requirements. I aspire to be a decent full-stack developer, but I am currently more skilled in back-end development.

I am currently working as a junior software developer therefore working in a team is something I am familiar with. I have worked with angular and similar frameworks such as ionic. I have not worked with python and PostGreSQL before but I am a fast learner and I am used to being around an environment of self learning.

I am currently working as a junior software engineer, that will benefit the team since I have an experience with how most things work. I have a knack for learning new programming technologies. I am flexible and I can learn new things fast. I am familiar with technologies that we are planning on using, I have worked different projects with Angular and 1 project with python specifically the flask framework.

I am a hardworking, ambitious student who is passionate about the field I am in. I have worked on a contract job for web application integration, therefore I have experience in the working world. I believe it will translate positively in approaching this project, in dealing with my team and conducting myself professionally. I have experience with front-end  as well as dealing with API's. I am eager to learn new languages and frameworks as I enjoy adding new tools to my developer toolbox.
