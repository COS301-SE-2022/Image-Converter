# HardCode Image-Converter

## Description
With our current climate of easy access to information, we are faced with the problem of information overload. Therefore it is important that we are able to view data in a concise format. This will allow us to understand the data in a comprehensive manner without getting distracted by unnecessary information. Graphing is a way to counter the problem effectively. However, mismatched or unclear graphs fail to help us understand the data adequately. 
The Image converter is a tool created for a Content Management System (CMS). It hosts a variety of functions of image manipulation, such as image cleaning, classification and filtering. The tool also manages uploaded images in a concise and efficient way.  The tool will be used solely by administrators of the CMS
